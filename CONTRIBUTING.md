## Pull requests

Please keep pull requests in scope and avoid including unrelated changes.

You may want to ask before embarking on a huge feature or refactor, we'd hate for you to waste your time on something that isn't in the best interest of the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation, comments, etc.). This project contains 2 styles of indentation that vary by component.

For any pull requests:
* Use a new branch specific to the pull request
* Tidy commits before pushing using [rebase/squash](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)

Thanks!
